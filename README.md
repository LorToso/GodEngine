# GodEngine
GodEngine is a small modular Java game engine that I developed during the first two semesters of university. It is fairly compatible to greenfoot, but supposed to have a vastly better performance and allow different modules to be plugged in (i.e. OpenGL as graphics library or touch screens instead of keyboard input etc).
